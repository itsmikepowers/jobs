Smart Screen

Glassdoor reskin
built on ai phone stuff
so we make it so when people go to the job listing they apply and then they get called

maybe make a way to do this on linkedin
then have people apply on linkedin or their own portal - then it sends a phone call within the next hour or so to do a prescreen

ask is this now a good time to call?
then when it does the outbound... screen and have it run a sequence - you can see all your applications inside smartscreen
